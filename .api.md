## Are.na API Details

• How does the search endpoint actually work? Does searching for a URL return the block ID first, then you need to fetch channels?
• What’s the exact data structure returned by the API?
• Do you have an API key/authentication requirements?
• What specific data do you want to extract from each channel?

To complete a search for a URL, we need to do the following...

1. We need to find all blocks that match the URL
2. With those blocks, we find the channels they are in
3. We look through all the channels to see all blocks with ("class": "Link") and store the URLs

----

### **To get all the matching Are.na blocks that match a URL, do the following (may need future optimization)**

1. Strip all contents from the URL other than the title and store as its own variable.
2. Input the variable in the GET v2/search/blocks?q=TITLE_GOES_HERE command
3. Look for the total_pages variable – you will need to iterate through these amount of pages in the following format:
1. GET v2/search/blocks?q=?page=CURRENT_PAGE
2. In the results of this search regardless of page, look at .blocks..source.url
3. If there is a match (can consider what this means – is this a complete match to the OG URL or do we accept extra slugs/text at the end), store that ID.

### **To then get all the channels the matching Are.na blocks are in**

For each block,

1. GET v2/blocks/BLOCK_ID_GOES_HERE/channels
2. Look for the total_pages variable – you will need to iterate through these amount of pages in the following format:
1. GET v2/blocks/BLOCK_ID_GOES_HERE/channels?page=CURRENT_PAGE
3. To get the URL of a given channel, it is are.na/owner_slug/slug

**The final view should have a toggle where users can see both the list of URLs but also Are.na channels, so the list of channels should be preserved and added to the database.**

**Finally, once we know all the valid Are.na channels, we go through them all looking for the website blocks and store their URLs. We should also store the amount of times a URL appears so if one continues to pop up it is highlighted as a top connection.**

This part requires us to use GET v2/channels/SLUG_GOES_HERE/contents and look for all blocks with class:"Link" and store their URLs.

**When you press on the ... on a Channel – We want there to be a few options – to *a) open the channel in a browser*, *b) see the other channels inside it*, and *c) the channels that have connected to it (opposite of b)***

a) Opening & hovering channel: When we press on a channel it should open the link in the browser, but when we hover on it I want to see a little info about the channel:

Kinda like what is in the native web app, you should see in a card the:

- title
  - Using /channels/slug_name/thumb:
    - at *.title*
- username (full name, not handle)
  - Using /channels/slug_name/thumb:
    - at *.user.full_name*
- amount of blocks
  - at *.length*
- **\# of channels that have connected to it**
  - Using /channels/slug_name/connections:
    - at .length
- \# thumbnail gallery
  - For now let's say we take the first max 6?
  - For each record under contents, find the *image.thumb.url* and render the image

b) see the channels inside it (inner)

- Using /channels/slug_name/contents and take the slug of all records where class="Channel"

c) see the channels that have connected to it (outer)

- Using /channels/slug_name/connections:
- Look for the total_pages variable – you will need to iterate through these amount of pages in the following format:

 1. GET v2/search/channels/slug_name/connections?page=CURRENT_PAGE

 1. In the results of this search regardless of page, store the .slug of each record
